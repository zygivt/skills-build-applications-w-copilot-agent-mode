## Step 5: Setup the frontend React framework, update the components, and start OctoFit Tracker app

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Setup the octofit-tracker frontend React framework.
- Update the following components to include the React framework:
  - src/App.js
  - src/index.js
  - src/components/Activities.js
  - src/components/Leaderboard.js
  - src/components/Teams.js
  - src/components/Users.js
  - src/components/Workouts.js
- Start the React app and check the output.

Copy and paste the following prompt(s) in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> - Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
> - Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
> - Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
> - Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.

**Open up a new Copilot Chat session by hitting the plus `+` icon in the Copilot Chat pane.**

>   for the Django rest framework backend.
>   make sure all components are pulling data from the REST api endpoint

> - Make sure to use the correct port and protocol http or https.
> - Update src/App.js to include the main navigation for all components.
> - Make sure react-router-dom is used for the navigation menu.
> - The react app should show the navigation menu and the components.
> - Update all components to log the fetched data and make them compatible with both paginated (.results) and plain array responses.
> - Add console.log statements to each component to log the fetched data and the REST API endpoints.

### :keyboard: Activity: Start the react app and check the output

Now, let's actually try running the react application! In the left sidebar, select the `Run and Debug` tab and then press the **Start Debugging** icon.

Go to the running React Frontend url that pops up for port 3000 that looks like the following:

<img alt="react-frontend-port" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0c8b213-ee5f-46dd-8675-686a7ba0818f" width=30% height=30%>

Once you open it in your web browser you will get a warning like the following:

<img alt="django-rest-api" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb52d137-e78d-440b-8e9c-c322d7c49b48" width=30% height=30%>

Once you click `Continue` it should look similar the following:

### :keyboard: Activity: Let's add some formatting, structuring, and styling to the octofit tracker app

### :keyboard: Optional Activity: Iterate on the appearance and try different models

> [!TIP]
> - Try creating your own prompts to change the application appearance, add features, and try different models.

1. Now that we have created the React frontend for all application components, let's check our changes in to our `build-octofit-app` branch.

1. With our new changes complete, please **commit** and **push** the changes to the `build-octofit-app` branch.

1. Wait a moment for Mona to check your work, provide feedback, and share the next lesson so we can keep working!
